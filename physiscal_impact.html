      <h2>Physical Impact</h2>
      <p>
As digital technologies become increasingly embedded in everyday routines, their influence is no longer limited to cognitive or social domains. Software now plays a significant role in shaping physical health both positively and negatively.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>One of the most immediate concerns is screen exposure. Prolonged use of digital devices, particularly in the evening, can disrupt sleep cycles. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25535358/" >Blue light</a> emitted by screens suppresses melatonin production, interfering with circadian rhythms and reducing sleep quality.
      </p>

      <br>

      <p>
        Equally concerning is the lack of movement associated with digital engagement. The widespread use of software in work and leisure contexts encourages <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21123641/" >sitting behaviour</a>. This is linked to increased risks of cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorders, and reduced life expectancy.
      </p>

      <br>

      <p>
        Vision health is also at risk. Extended screen time has been associated with <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35809192/" >digital eye strain</a> symptoms include dry eyes, blurred vision, and headaches. With the average adult spending over seven hours per day interacting with screens, the physical strain on the eyes is becoming a widespread issue.
      </p>

      <br>

      <p>
        However, digital technologies also present opportunities. Health apps and wearable devices are increasingly effective at encouraging physical activity and providing personalized health feedback. These tools show promise in helping users monitor and improve their physical well-being.

      </p>

      <br>

      <p>In short, software is no longer a purely digital concern it is a physical one. As our reliance on technology grows, recognizing and addressing its impact on the body is essential for maintaining long-term health. This is why it is important to introduce the additional R of responsible in the FAIR principles. Too make sure the (open) research software is developed responsibly, to reduce addictive qualities for example and increase activity.</p>
