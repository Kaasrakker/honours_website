      <h2>General Information</h2>
      <p>
        Concerns surrounding data protection have been a key focus for policymakers, leading to the introduction of numerous regulations aimed at ensuring responsible handling and security of data. Prominent examples include the <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a>, the <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</a>, and the <a href="https://www.government.nl/topics/personal-data/data-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA)</a>. These regulations prioritize secure data storage, ethical collection practices, and obtaining explicit user consent.     
      </p>
      <br>
      <p> 
        Within the Utrecht University, and others, a lot of data is collected and used. With the new developments in the area of AI and vast amounts of data getting collected everyday, it is essential for the scientific community to be able to share and utilise this to innovate. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        This is why there are already <a href="https://wwwnaturecom.utrechtuniversity.idm.oclc.org/articles/sdata201618" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAIR principles</a> for scientific data management and stewardship, developed in 2016 by a large collaboration of scientists. The FAIR principles stand for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. This means data being produced needs to be easily located, accessible to everyone, usable for everyone and be able to be reused using some kind of licence for example.       
      </p>
      <p>    
        These principles have also been adopted by the University of Utrecht, who provide <a href="https://www.uu.nl/en/research/research-data-management/tools/fair-cheatsheets-to-publish-your-research-data-and-software-fair" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cheat sheets</a> on how to apply the FAIR principles.       
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        However, these principles are aimed mainly at the use of data. Despite this, no guidelines of principles have been developed for responsible use of software. This is where the development of a new letter comes into play, the addition of R for Responsible. Additionally it is important to make a distinction between data, software and artificial intelligence software(AI). <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/data" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data</a> is specifically numbers and information, whilst <a href="https://www-jstor-org.utrechtuniversity.idm.oclc.org/stable/25668234" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">software</a> are the instructions to control a computer and lastly <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/12/06/artificial-intelligence-act-council-calls-for-promoting-safe-ai-that-respects-fundamental-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI software</a> is developed through machine learning, logic based and knowledge based.   
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Software, just like data should be developed and researched responsibly, as software is an integral part of daily life. It influences almost each aspect of our daily lives from dusk, with an alarm clock, to dawn with the use of television, or doing the laundry. Software can be found in all shapes and sizes, as it is anything that utilises some form of digital processing. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        However, unlike data collection regulations and requirements on how handle data responsible, software, and specifically research software developed by universities and researchers, have no form of guideline. As unresponsible data forms risks in the form <a href="https://www-sciencedirect-com.utrechtuniversity.idm.oclc.org/science/article/pii/S0378720622000507" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">data leaks</a> or <a href="https://www.rechtspraak.nl/Organisatie-en-contact/Organisatie/Raad-voor-de-rechtspraak/Nieuws/Paginas/Onderzoek-naar-uithuisplaatsing-kinderen-van-toeslagenouders-afgerond.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">misclassification</a>, software can have serious impacts on the <a href="economic_impact.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">economy</a>, <a href="environmental_impact.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">environment</a>, <a href="physicial_impact.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">physical</a> and <a href="psychological_impact.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">psychological</a>.
