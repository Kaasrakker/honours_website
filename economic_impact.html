      <h2>Economic Impact</h2>
      <h3>Upsides</h3>

      <p>
Software has become immensely important in the economy, providing new opportunities and offering new chances. This has been especially useful in the businesses who have implemented open-software have been able to reduce expenses by a total of <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220510553_A_Cost_Model_of_Open_Source_Software_Adoption" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >20-30%</a>.
      </p>

    <br>

    <p>
      As a result cost efficiency has risen, allowing more extensive growth, which is an economical advantage. However, the difference between software and open-software is important to remember, as it is evident that the issue of intellectual property plays a large role in the impact on the economy. This property allows people to claim something to be theirs, and add complexity to the economic model. 
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>As mentioned before, the open software allows more people to work on something, <a href=" https://www.researchgate.net/publication/48459022_Challenges_of_Open_Innovation_The_Paradox_of_Firm_Investment_in_Open-Source_Software" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >accelerating innovation and technological development</a>.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h3>Downsides</h3>

    <p>
      Despite the aforementioned benefits there are also some downsides. An example is the cost of an open-source software project to promote innovation costs money. These projects often require a different kind <a href="https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/publications/Dynamics%20of%20Open%20Source.pdf" > value generation</a> to challenge traditional software development. 
    </p>
    <br>

    <p>
      However, companies have executed this commercially, with companies such as <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/368490521_The_Profitability_and_Effectiveness_of_Merger_Arbitrage_Evidence_from_IBM_Red_Hat" > Red Hat </a> using monetized open-source models to provide enterprise level services. 
    </p>

    <p>Despite the challenges (research) software has many benefits of being open-source, as it can be used to drive innovation and sustain economic growth for the long term. </p>
